/* BUILD A TIP CALCULATOR APP
 These are the functions you must use
 ======================================
 calculateBill() //something to calculate Bill Total
 increasePeople() // something to increase people
 decreasePeople() // something to decrease people

 these functions are hard coded in the HTML
 so, we cannot change the names.

 These are the <div id=""> we need to access.
 ===================================
 billTotalInput = user input for bill total
 tipAmount = user input for tip
 numberOfPeople = current number of people splitting bill
 perPersonalTotal = total dollar value owed per person
